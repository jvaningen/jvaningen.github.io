 	<h2>Digital Marketing and Communications</h2>
 	<br>

     <p> Although my official title at <a href="http://www.holyapostlessoupkitchen.org">Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen</a> is Foundation Relations Officer and Database Manager, I am an editor by trade and am frequently called upon to work on communications projects, such as our website, social media, email marketing and media relations. </p>
     <br>

     <h2>Website</h2>
     <br>
      <p>I add content using WordPress and also analyze our website using Google Analytics. I&#39;m also knowledgeable about search engine optimization. For example, adding descriptions to photos (i.e. alt="websitecopy") not only helps people with visual impairment, it also helps improve search engine ranking. </p>

     <br>
     <br>   
     <h2>Social Media</h2>
     <br>
     <p> I am an administrator for our Facebook page, and add content to Twitter as well.

     <h2>Social Media Advertising</h2> 
    <br>
     <p> I am the project manager for 2015's year-end social media advertising campaign. I created a budget and a calendar that integrated with our social media calendar. Here is an example of our success.</p>

<br>
     <h2>Email Marketing</h2>
     <br>
     <p>We take photos of volunteer groups for social media purposes, and I send emails to the volunteers using Constant Contact. I also successfully advocated to add first name and last name fields to our Email sign-up form located on our website&#39;s homepage; by doing so, we have increased our mailing list by 10%. <p>
      <br>
    <p>Here is a preview of one of our emails; when the email is sent out, the person's name appears in the contact name field. Our average open rate is 35%</p>

     <br>
   <br>
     <h2>Media Relations</h2>
     <br>
     <p> At the end of 2014, the Soup Kitchen was on the front page of the New York Times. Because they are supporters and/or volunteers, I have relationships with the NYT, NY1 News and Bloomberg Corporation. Additionally, I have formed relationships with foundation officers and have thought outside the box to get foundation and corporate grants; I can transfer this experience to form relationships with journalists and secure media placement.<br>
      <br>
     <p>Earlier in my career, I worked at <a href="https://www.helenkeller.org/"> Helen Keller Services for the Blind</a> and wrote press releases and secured media placement in Valley Stream Herald, Newsday and NY Daily News. Because of my previous experience as a journalist, I have connections to Gay City News, the Villager and Chelsea Now. </p>
