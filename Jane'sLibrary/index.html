				<div id="AboutMe"> 
				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<br>
				<p>I am an avid reader and generally read a book a week. I regularly read <a href="http://www.npr.org/books/">NPR</a> and <a href="http://www.lambdaliterary.org/">Lambda Literary</a> to discover new books to read.</p> 
				<br>
				<p>As a native New Yorker, I love to read books about New York history, such as Robin Schulman&#39;s <span>Eat The City</span>, which is about the fishers, butchers, farmers, beekeepers, and brewers who built this city. As someone who became a dog person later in life, I loved Benoit Denizen-Lewis&#39;s <span>Travels with Casey</span>, which details his cross-country trip with his dog and the other dog lovers he meets along the way. As a former editor and writer who wrote many personality profiles, I also love memoirs, such as  <span>Shouting Won&#39;t Help</span>, a memoir about hearing loss by Katherine Bouton. I also read a fair amount about music, including David Byrne&#39;s <span>How Music Works.</span></p> 
 				<br>
				<p>I&#39;ve worked in the non-profit sector for a number of years. For books, articles, websites and databases pertaining to the non-profit sector, you can&#39;t go wrong with <a href="http://www.foundationcenter.org">The Foundation Center</a>. They have information about all aspects of fundraising and non-profit management, not just foundations.</p>
				<br> 
				<p>I am also interested in technology, and it&#39;s important to me that everyone be able to use the Internet. I work at Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen and we redesigned our <a href="http://holyapostlessoupkitchen.org">website</a> in 2014. One of things we did was optimize the website for mobile and test the website in older browsers. We haven&#39;t received any complaints about our donation or volunteer forms since the redesign. <p>
					<br>
				<p>This website was created for my final project at General Assembly's Front-End Web Development course. In the summer of 2015, I took Digital Marketing at the same school.</p><br>
