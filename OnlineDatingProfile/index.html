             	  		<h2>About Me</h2>

 						<p>I am part-owner of the DragonFly Inn, and am mother to Rory. I&#39;ve lived in this kooky town of Stars Hollow since I was a teenager, which is when I had Rory, and ran away from home to find my own life away from my parents&#39; expectations to be a proper lady of society. I stopped being a child the minute the strip turned pink, okay? I had to figure out how to live, so I worked up the ranks to become a manager to get to where I am today. </p>
  						<br>
						<p>I talk fast, especially when I&#39;m upset, have a deprecating sense of humor, am witty and quirky, drop obscure pop references at the drop of a hat, and love hanging out at Luke&#39;s diner with the other locals. I consider lettuce a vegetable, I need coffee like I need oxygen, and I don&#39;t take anything for granted, especially Pop-Tarts. Pop-Tarts taste like freedom, rebellion and independence.</p> 
						<br>
						<p>Life with me is never dull or boring. Just ask Rory:
						<br>
						<p> <div id="text">My mother never gave me any idea that I couldn&#39;t do whatever I wanted to do or be whomever I wanted to be. She filled our house with love, fun, books and music, unflagging in her efforts to give me role models from Jane Austen to Eudora Welty to Patti Smith.</div></p>
						<br>
						<p>What am I looking for from a man? To find a nice person to hang out with &#39;til we drop dead, it's all any of us wants. Not a lot to ask.</p>
